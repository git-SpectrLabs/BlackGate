# BlackGate
BlackGate is not a home router. It's a door you choose to open. A plug-and-play anonymity box built on Raspberry Pi. Tor over Mullvad VPN via secure SOCKS5 proxy. Only traffic you manually route goes anonymous - the rest stays normal via your ISP. Killswitch for proxy traffic. Endpoint pinning. DNS leak protection. No logs. Autostart at boot.
